# ELibraryManagmentSystem
An E Library Management System made in C++ 
Write a program in C++ that implements a simple e-library management system. The program should provide a menu which allows the user to do the following: 40
a. Add A New Book
b. Edit Details of an Available Book
c. Delete A Book
d. Display All Books in the Library
The book class contains the following attributes:
● Publication ID (This is unique, you must use this variable for searching purposes) 
● Book Title
● Author(s)
● List of Patron Subscribers
The program should prevent addition of duplicate books entries using the unique publication id. All books should be stored in a file. The program should be implemented using character arrays only, (Using string is prohibited). Additionally, you should consider using OOP concepts such as classes, default or parameterized and copy constructors in your program.
